  <h1>The Coronavirus Self-Isolation Half Marathon</h1>
  <p>The emergency measures are kicking in and the events we've been training for are getting cancelled. 
    Many of us are self-isolating or withdrawing from large-scale social events to help slow the spread 
    of COVID-19.</p>
  <p>All that preparation needn't be wasted. Instead of withdrawing into inactivity, let's pull our various 
  events together virtually.</p>
  <p>Each of us can run our own run, without the crowds. Find a reasonably secluded route and do the run 
  you would have done if COVID-19 hadn't scuppered the plans.</p>
  <p>Register your event here and keep your own time. We'll have a leaderboard for all the disparate runs 
  people are doing.</p>
  <p>You are welcome to register your own fundraising cause, but any contributions to 
  <%= link_to "https://www.justgiving.com/team/team-sacha" do %>
    the cause for which we're fundraising
  <% end %>
  are greatly appreciated.</p>
