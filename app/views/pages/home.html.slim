  h1.py-5 The Coronavirus Self-Isolation Half Marathon
  p
    | The emergency measures are kicking in and the events we've been training for are getting cancelled. 
    | Many of us are self-isolating or withdrawing from large-scale social events to help slow the spread 
    | of COVID-19.
  p
    | All that preparation needn't be wasted. Instead of withdrawing into inactivity, let's pull our various 
    | events together virtually.
  p
    | Each of us can run our own run, without the crowds. Find a reasonably secluded route and do the run
    | you would have done if COVID-19 hadn't scuppered the plans.
  p
    | Register your event here and keep your own time. We'll have a leaderboard for all the disparate runs 
    | people are doing.
  p
    | You are welcome to register your own fundraising cause, but any contributions to the cause for which 
    | we're fundraising are greatly appreciated.
